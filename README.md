## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a computational chemist from Innsbruck, Austria, currently living in Switzerland.
I am a member of @rinikerlab, where I am doing my Postdoc. Before that, I was a member of @liedllab in Innsbruck, where I did my PhD.

These are the repositories where I am the main (or one of the main) contributors:
* [gisttools](https://github.com/liedllab/gisttools) - for post-processing Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory calculations (GIST)
* [second-disorder](https://github.com/liedllab/second-disorder) - a Python implementation of second-order corrections for GIST
* [PEP-Patch](https://github.com/liedllab/surface_analyses) - a Python tool to visualize electrostatic and hydrophobic surfaces of large molecules
* [msms-wrapper](https://github.com/rinikerlab/msms_wrapper) - A simple Python wrapper for the msms program by Michel Sanner
* [macrocycle-ff-validation](https://github.com/rinikerlab/macrocycle-ff-validation) - Code and data for my paper on force field validation for macrocycles.
